## ROLE DETECTION

**CRITICAL**: Before reading further, check your role:
```bash
cat .agent_role
```

**If your role is one of these SPECIALISTS:**
- `devops-engineer` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/devops-engineer.md`
- `qa-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/qa-specialist.md`
- `release-manager` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/release-manager.md`
- `documentation-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/documentation-specialist.md`
- `project-orchestrator` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/project-orchestrator.md`

**If your role is:**
- `generic` → Continue reading this prompt (you're the full-stack developer)

---

**Available specialized agents** (description only, see full prompts in `/agents/`):
- `generic` - Full-stack developer, implement everything
- `devops-engineer` - CI/CD, infrastructure, GitHub Actions
- `qa-specialist` - Testing, quality assurance, test automation
- `release-manager` - Versioning, releases, deployment coordination
- `documentation-specialist` - Docs, READMEs, technical writing

## GENERIC DEVELOPER MODE

## CORE MISSION
1. Read `TASKS.md`
2. Complete ONE task per iteration
3. Update `TASKS.md` with progress: Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Commit & push to GitHub
5. Repeat until all tasks done

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS DO FIRST

**Task 0: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup** (Do before Task 1)

Detect tech stack from these files:
| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `package.json` | Node.js |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Python |
| `go.mod` or `go.sum` | Go |

## CALLING SPECIALIZED AGENTS

If a task needs a specialist you can't handle alone, update `.agent_role`:

```bash
# Switch to a specialist for specific work
echo "devops-engineer" > .agent_role
git add .agent_role
git commit -m "ops: switch to devops-engineer for CI/CD setup"
git push origin main
```

After switching, the next iteration will load that agent's expertise.

**Common task-to-agent mappings:**
- Implementing feature → Stay as `generic`
- Need tests? → Switch to `qa-specialist`
- Ready to release? → Switch to `release-manager`
- Need better docs? → Switch to `documentation-specialist`
- Complex multi-part work? → Switch to `project-orchestrator`
- Setting up CI/CD? → Switch to `devops-engineer`

Switch back to `generic` when the specialist work is done.

---

**Now start: Check `.agent_role` and read TASKS.md**

- [ ] Implement HuggingFace transformer integration: Create wrapper classes for transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, XLNet) with unified interface, supporting custom heads for classification
  - Deliverable: `src/models/transformers.py` with model factory pattern, individual model classes for each architecture, and configuration handling
- [ ] Build classical ML model implementations: Implement traditional models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) using scikit-learn and compare against transformers
  - Deliverable: `src/models/classical.py` with all classical model implementations, hyperparameter tuning configurations, and comparison baseline script
- [ ] Implement state-of-the-art models beyond transformers: Add cutting-edge models like ELECTRA, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and potentially GPT-based classifiers to ensure comprehensive coverage
  - Deliverable: Extended `src/models/transformers.py` with additional models, model zoo configuration in `config/models.yaml`, and training scripts for each model family
- [ ] Create unified training pipeline: Implement modular training loop with logging, checkpointing, early stopping, mixed precision training, and support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow backends
  - Deliverable: `src/training.py` with complete training pipeline, `src/train.py` CLI, configuration schema in `config/training_schema.yaml`, and comprehensive documentation

## Phase 4: Experimentation, Logging & Analysis
- [ ] Set up comprehensive MLFlow experiment tracking: Create separate experiments for each model family, implement custom MLFlow tags (model_type, dataset_version, preprocessing_config), and enable artifact logging for models and predictions
  - Deliverable: `src/experiment_tracker.py` with experiment management functions, automated tagging system, and artifact storage structure in `artifacts/`
- [ ] Design hyperparameter optimization framework: Integrate Optuna or Ray Tune with MLFlow for automated hyperparameter search across all models, define search spaces for each model architecture
  - Deliverable: `src/hyperopt.py` with optimization loops, search space definitions in `config/hyperparams/`, script `scripts/run_hyperopt.py`, and example results
- [ ] Implement automated model evaluation suite: Create evaluation script that computes all metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, inference latency, memory footprint) and logs them consistently
  - Deliverable: `src/evaluation.py` with comprehensive metrics calculation, `scripts/evaluate_all.py` for batch evaluation, standardized MLFlow metrics naming, and comparison tables generation
- [ ] Build analysis and visualization dashboards: Create Jupyter notebooks and Streamlit/Plotly Dash app for interactive comparison of all models, metric correlation analysis, and statistical significance testing
  - Deliverable: Interactive dashboard `app/dashboard.py` or `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`, comparison visualizations (bar charts, ROC curves, latency vs accuracy plots), statistical test results in `docs/model_comparison.md`
- [ ] Generate final report and recommendations: Compile comprehensive comparison report with best-performing models per metric, computational cost analysis, and deployment recommendations
  - Deliverable: Final report `docs/FINAL_REPORT.md` with executive summary, detailed model comparison tables, deployment guidelines, `models/best_models/` directory with top 3 models saved, and reproducibility checklist

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Ensure reproducibility: Implement deterministic training where possible, log all random seeds, dependency versions, and hardware specifications
  - Deliverable: `src/reproducibility.py` with seed management, complete environment logging to MLFlow, and reproducibility documentation
- [ ] Implement model artifact management: Create standardized model packaging (ONNX conversion where applicable), versioning scheme, and export formats for deployment
  - Deliverable: Model export utilities in `src/export.py`, standardized artifact structure, and deployment instructions in `docs/deployment.md`
